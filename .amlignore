# Note the ignore function in AzureML does not work properly. 
# If we specify to ignore datasets/, it will also ignore the 
# maskrcnn_benchmark/data/datasets/ folder and it will cause 
# problem. As a workaround, I renamed my local dataset path
# as datasets1/. I have submitted this issue to the AML team.
